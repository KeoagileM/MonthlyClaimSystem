## How it works for the Lecturer
- After the lecture logs in to the system, they are given the chance to choose the the module they are claiming for, show the hours worked, the hourly rate and the document that supports the claim that is being submitted. In this dashboard it will also show the claim history as shown below

- The claim history shows the statuses of the claims. They show rejected, approved, and pending

## How it works for the Programme Coordinator
- After you log in as the programme coordinator, you will see the dashboard of the coordinator which has the report of the claims that have been submitted, which are pending.
- It gives you the option to approve or to disapprove the claim, and can give reasons on why is was disapproved

- When the claim is reviewed and accepted by the coordinator it shows that it has been reviewed in the review history.

## How it works for the Programme Manager
- After you have logged in as the manager  you will see a dashboard as the manager that will contain all the claims reports and the total value of the claims that are accepted or rejected by the coordinator and gives the manager a chance to accept or reject.
